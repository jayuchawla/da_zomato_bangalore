Lamb Crosstini, Chicken Shahi Korma, Mutton Biriyani (not of a typical South Indian minty taste) and caramel pudding, are few of the delicacies that one must try in there. The overall experience was good. Nice place for a friendly hangout or get together.'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\\n  We took a pool side dinner package from cherishx. The setup is rely nice, considering the cost. The pool was neat and well maintained. The staff were attentive and courteous. The food was slightly a let down. The most of the items were decent, but nothing stood out. The pork chops were quite good, with the right mix of flavours. Some of the starters were lacking in salt. Same goes for the pasta. The cocktail was good and different.

The food is the best in town for its taste and is totally value for money. The food takes about 15 minutes or so to arrive but the wait is totally worth it.
